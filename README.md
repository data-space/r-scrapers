# Web Scraping Using R Software

# Introduction
 
Web scraping is a data-extraction technique used to collect data from one or more web pages. Data collection is one of the most important and time-consuming steps in data science and analytics. Because of the Internet, the data collection process has become less cumbersome. Not only does the Internet provide ready-to-use datasets, but it has also created new forms of data-collection processes, such as, automated-data collection and web scraping.  Data comes in many different formats, types, and platforms. Scraping the web allows one to collect data from different sources and combine them into one file. 
 
# Objective 

The objective of this project is to learn different web scraping techniques using R software. This project will focus on scraping data from the web into a csv file, and cleaning the data until it is usable for analyses. 

Note: Proficient programming skills in R is expected.
 
## Topics will include:

·  	Create datasets by accessing information online in HTML, HTTP, XML, JSON, Javascript, and SQL generated formats

·  	Extract data in html tables, on parts of an html page, and on multiple websites

·  Learn to slice and dice, parse documents, query web documents and datasets

·  	Program a twitter bot for automated collection

·  	Connect to web services/APIs to collect data

·  	Scrape different sources such as newspaper data, Wikipedia, social media, and web services

·  	 After collecting the data, it will be processed, cleaned, and debugged until its useable for analyses
